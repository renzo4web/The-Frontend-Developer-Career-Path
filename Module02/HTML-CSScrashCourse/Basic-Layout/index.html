        <h3>Their history</h3>
        <p>
          Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria.

        <p>
          They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23
          million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the
          evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research.
        </p>
        <p>
          They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
          Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their
          dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
          Reverse genetic engineering and the fossil record both demonstrate
          that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier
          theropods during the late Jurassic Period.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the
          Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs
          can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian
          dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. This article
          deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.

        <h3>People love dinosaurs!</h3>
        <p>
          Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th
          century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions
          at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring
          part of world culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly
          monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular
          appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in
          significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are
          regularly covered by the media.

        "There's an incomparable rush that comes from finding dinosaur bones.
        You know you're the first person to lay hands on a critter that lived 80
        or 90 million years ago."
