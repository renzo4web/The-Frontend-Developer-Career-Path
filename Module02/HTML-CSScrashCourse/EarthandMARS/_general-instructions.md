Your job is to create a 3 page website about Earth and Mars.

Use the corresponding .md files for the text of your pages.

- Hashtags indicate headings
    - # title  = h1
    - ### title = h3
- Any text with stars around it *like this* must be italic
- Any text with underscores on both sides of it _like this_ must be bold
- Links are shown like this:  [this text is a link](this-is-where-it-links-to.html)
- The images are are in a folder called 'images' already. Don't forget the `alt` text!
- Lines starting with a hyphen (like this one), are an unordered list

- CSS:
  - Change the font-size of the h1 on all pages to: 60px
  - Change the color of the h1 and all h2 on the mars page to: #d33d1f
  - Change the colors of the h1 and all h2 on the earth page to: #2a8442
