    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Earth is <strong>the third planet from the Sun</strong>, and
      <strong>the only astronomical object known to harbor life</strong>.

    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>

    <p>
      Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400
      seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar
      day is now <em>slightly</em> longer than it was during the 19th century
      due to tidal deceleration,
      <strong>each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar
      day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service
      (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m
      4.0989s. Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean
      vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean
      solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s). Thus the sidereal day is shorter than
      the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[187] The length of the mean solar day in
      SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005[188] and
      1962–2005.

    <p>
      Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the
      main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at
      a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is
      equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two
      minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon
      are approximately the same.
    </p>

    <h3>Orbit</h3>

    <p>
      Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93
      million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This
      gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars
      at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter
      every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar
      day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun
      returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78
      km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance
      equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes,
      and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to
      the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common
      orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to
      new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion
      of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise.
      Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and
      Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The
      orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted
      some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the
      ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against
      the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every
      two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.
